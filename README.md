# minecraft-darktorchesmod-1.12.2
A Minecraft mod that aims to increase difficulty in a unique way: make light be a resource, but don't make it annoyingly tedious. It provides a configurable brightness amount that can be lowered globally across all light sources(including modded) and adds a new costly light source that ignores those constraints and lights up very bright.
